A component for review breakdowns like at The Verge.

##### Example

    <review-breakdown items="{{list of items as maps with label and heat}}">
      <h4>The Breakdown</h4>
      <p>More times than not, the Verge score is based on the average of the subscores below. However, since this is a non-weighted average, we reserve the right to tweak the overall score if we feel it doesn't reflect our overall assessment and price of the product. Read more about how we test and rate products.</p>
